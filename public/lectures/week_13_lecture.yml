    text: "Last week we took some time to think about different strategies narratives use to compress three-dimensional space down to two dimensions. We'll see another interesting example this week in Gus Van Sant's film, <em>Elephant</em>. We'll also take some time this week to look at strategies for dealing with another important dimension of narrative: How to compress time. In this film, Van Sant makes some rather unconventional choices in how to present both time and space. As you watch, think about the duration of Van Sant’s shots; think about how the different shots intersect with each other in space; think about how Van Sant manipulates chronology."

      - text: "In this scene, Renoir makes use of both a mobile camera and deep space to underscore his intended theme of community. In the opening moments of the shot, we think the two characters are alone, but then the camera cranes up to display the crowd of other members of the collective who are also watching. We get a sense of the close proximity of the collective and the way that everyone is involved in even the small acts that occur. When we cut into the room of Charlie, they pull the advertisement off the window to reveal the courtyard and the laundromat across the courtyard. Renoir could have cut to shots of Estelle being brought over and coming to talk (the wide shot from Charlie's room is not a very good vantage point to see the action playing out across the courtyard), but because it all happens in the same shot, it underscores just how close together everything is and how connected all the various members of the community are. It's a subtle detail, but still an important example of a director choosing the techniques that best underscore the emotional and thematic content."

        text: "SPACE AND THE FRAME"
      - text: "In addition to compressing three dimensions down to two, cinema is also presenting its diegetic world through a comparatively small window. In the real world, we see a roughly 180-degree span in front of us. With the narrative world, we’re filling a small fraction of that. Even in a theater with a widescreen image, the screen only occupies the central sliver of our range of vision.   In the theater space, our gaze is highly constricted. We’re looking through a porthole into another world. To expand that narrative world beyond the porthole, cinema makes use of sound. In order to create a more enveloping world that surrounds us, cinema only needs to suggest its existence. We may be made aware of all kinds of people, objects, and entire events that occur outside of our range of sight."

        text: "OFFSCREEN SPACE"
      - text: "At times throughout this film, we do see the villain of this movie, a child murderer, onscreen. However, Lang also gives the character a distinctive signature in the form of his repetitive whistling of Edvard Grieg’s <em>In the Hall of the Mountain King</em>. In this scene, we only know of the presence of the character because of his whistle (we see his shadow briefly, but without the whistle, we wouldn’t know whose shadow it was). Because of this sound, the blind balloon salesman is able to recognize him as the murderer. As the scene plays out, we’re made aware of number of activities occurring offscreen through the use of sound. Instead of cutting to a shot of the man in the distance bending down to talk to a little girl, the information is conveyed through sound and we &quot;see&quot; it occurring through our imagination."
      - text: "Why do you think Lang chooses to present this scene this way? Is he too lazy to set up an eyeline match shot to show us what the young man is seeing? Shouldn’t the story work better if we actually get to see the details? Is there anything Lang might be gaining by not showing the action to us?"
      - text: "Violence is occasionally treated this way (and usually this kind of violence––suggested, but not seen––is far more harrowing than gore). We are shown the implements involved in the violence, and we might be shown the aftermath, but the violent act itself is left to our imagination (think of the &quot;ear scene&quot; in <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>) and only suggested through sound."

        text: "<em>ELEPHANT</em>"
      - text: "This film, a fictionalized retelling of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, is an interesting case study, both in its treatment of space and of time (through a weird coincidence, this screening always seems to fall very close to the anniversary of the Columbine shootings. Not sure why that's happened). Gus Van Sant faces a challenge: if both the ending and the climactic moments in the story are already known to the viewer, how does the filmmaker create an interesting presentation of the information? Van Sant attempts to solve this problem by creating an unusual (cinematically-speaking) approach to addressing the issues of space and time."
      - text: "Van Sant is dealing with an event that occurs in a confined space (a space that is made up of numerous identical-looking maze-like hallways) over a defined duration of a few minutes. It would be difficult to present the layout of the school through a series of shots cut together. We would have no way of knowing how close one event was to another in space. And we might not have a clear sense of whether (or how much) time had been excised between the cuts. Further, the locations of the events and their place in the story’s timeline are important. The viewer needs to have an understanding of the proximity of events to understand the intertwined pathways of the various characters and in order to grasp fully the somewhat random nature of the explosive events."
      - text: "The primary difference between a sad event and one that seems tragic to us as viewers is that the tragic event is one that, with a little bit of luck, could have been avoided. By mapping out each character’s pathway through space and time, revealing the random events that led certain characters to be in the path of danger, and demonstrating how their fates, to a large extent, are decided by chance, the story becomes more poignant and the tragedy more evident to the viewer."
      - text: "In one of your readings for this week, J.J. Murphy discusses Van Sant’s approach to scripting the film. Instead of a screenplay, Van Sant ended up with a map tracing the paths of the various characters through the school. It’s interesting that most screenplays are primarily lists of dialog. This seems to suggest that in many films, the interactions between the subjects drive the development of character and the events of the plot. If Van Sant’s script is in fact a map, it seems to suggest that he has removed dialog as the driving factor of the story and replaced it with movement through space. He does this through the use of the Steadicam and the long-take tracking shot."
      - text: "The playwright, director and screenwriter David Mamet has said, in his book <em>On Directing Film</em> (well worth reading, by the way. And it’s short!), that he hates the Steadicam, since it allows filmmakers to be lazy in shot construction, simply following the characters around with the camera rather than making intelligent decisions on how to frame a shot and what precise moments need to be included. In <em>Elephant</em> we’re faced with a movie in which the Steadicam is used in precisely the way that Mamet seems to despise."
      - text: "However, in this case, the choice to use the Steadicam is not simply one of expedience. It’s a specific strategy: in an event in which the exact moment in which you walk through a hallway means the difference between life and death, a strategy that maps both the spatial and temporal locations of the individual characters ends up being the most effective at accomplishing Van Sant’s goals for the film. Because of the use of the long-take follow shot, we get a sense of the structure of the building which, according to Van Sant, emphasizes the regimentation and sense of dislocation and the lack of connections between characters."

        text: TIME
      - text: "Another aspect of <em>Elephant</em> that is unusual is the way in which it cuts up and presents time to us. This week we’ll look at how <em>Elephant</em> manipulates time, then next week we’ll broaden our discussion and look at more general ideas about addressing the problem of time."
      - text: "If we look at how narrative cinema can manipulate time, we can divide these variables up into three categories: the <em><strong>order</strong></em> of events, their <em><strong>duration</strong></em>, and their <em><strong>frequency</strong></em>. First, let's lay out our own human experience of time and see where that falls in these categories. As humans, we experience events in chronological order. We can’t physically leap back and forth through time to rearrange our experience of when things occur. We also experience the duration of events in &quot;real time&quot;, meaning that time is linear and continuous. There are no gaps in our bodies’ experience of time. Lastly, we experience events only once (and we experience repetitive tasks as many times as they occur, as much as we might wish to skip over them)."
      - text: "As we mentioned last week, early cinema approached both space and time in a very literal manner. The single, long, uninterrupted take of the earliest films was faithful to the sense of time detailed above. However, we should pause for a moment and question whether this description of the way humans experience time is actually accurate."

    text: "Last week we took some time to think about different strategies narratives use to compress three-dimensional space down to two dimensions. We'll see another interesting example this week in Gus Van Sant's film, <em>Elephant</em>. We'll also take some time this week to look at strategies for dealing with another important dimension of narrative: How to compress time. In this film, Van Sant makes some rather unconventional choices in how to present both time and space. As you watch, think about the duration of Van Santâ€™s shots; think about how the different shots intersect with each other in space; think about how Van Sant manipulates chronology."

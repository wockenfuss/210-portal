        text: "Course Description"
      - text: "This course is a study of several fundamental aspects of filmmaking technique, revolving primarily around an exploration of the way cinema makes use of the frame, mise-en-scene, editing, sound, time and space. Through weekly film screenings, readings, creative exercises, writing and discussion, students will develop an analytical approach toward their own film viewing and image-making practices, learning to think and write critically about the role of media in contemporary culture."

        text: "Course Requirements"
      - text: "Because this course takes place entirely online you will need several skills and resources to be able to participate fully."
      - text: "-You will need basic word processing skills and some form of word processing software (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Pages, etc.)."
      - text: "-You will need to be able to access and navigate the course D2L site. Google Chrome is the recommended browser to use, followed by Firefox and Safari at a distant third. Internet Explorer is strongly recommended against. There might be occasional issues with media playback and display on other browsers."
      - text: "-Since e-mail will be one of the primary forms of communication for this class, you will need to check your campus e-mail account on a daily basis, or have e-mail forwarded to an address you check daily."
      - text: "-You will need routine access to a computer with a broadband Internet connection or a campus network connection to the Web. Ideally this connection should be wired (i.e. Ethernet connection rather than Wi-Fi). If you don't have a computer or home broadband, you will need to make plans to use one of the campus lab computers (see the link to campus computer labs in the D2L &quot;Content&quot; section)."
      - text: "-If you have technical difficulties with D2L contact the UWM Technology Help Desk through the link on the D2L Content page under Resources and Help"
      - text: "-The computer you use must be able to view Quicktime videos (standard on Macs, see link in D2L &quot; Content&quot; section for Windows)."

      - "Each week you will be assigned a film to watch. There are several possibilities as to how you can watch the films each week. Due to the occasionally precarious nature of technology, you should make contingency plans for alternate ways to view the film should your normal method not be available in a given week. Not being able to watch a film due to technical problems will not excuse you from that week's quiz and discussion requirements. In the class schedule section of this syllabus and on D2L there will be a list of the films we will watch each week and where they are currently available for streaming.Due to the contemporary system for licensing, streaming rights for films can be constantly in flux. Because of this, unfortunately, all of the films we will be watching this semester are not available for streaming through a single service. Some films available now for streaming on Netflix or Amazon, may not be available for streaming by the time we get to that film's week in the schedule. Here are the ways to view each week's film:"
      - "<em>D2L Streaming</em>: I will be attempting to provide a free stream of each week’s film embedded in the D2L Content section. However, this may not always be possible, in which case, you may need to rent these films through Amazon streaming or iTunes. Be aware that the quality of the free stream will most likely be lower than what you'd get from streaming the film through Amazon or Netflix or downloading it from iTunes, so if you can at all afford it, I'd suggest watching it by another method."
      - "<em>Amazon Instant Video</em>: Almost all the films for the semester are currently available for rental through Amazon Instant Video."
      - "<em>iTunes store</em>: Roughly half the films we will be watching will be available for rental through the iTunes store."
      - "<em>Netflix</em>: A few of the films we are watching are available for streaming through Netflix. Most of the films are available on DVD through Netflix, so if you currently have a Netflix subscription, or are planning to subscribe for the semester, you may wish to order the DVDs to watch each week. You will need to plan ahead however, to ensure that you have the appropriate DVD at the appropriate time. Also, if too many people are trying to access the DVD through Netflix, it's possible that Netflix will not have enough DVD copies of a film to meet demand. So have a backup plan in the case that you can't get the DVD on time!"
      - "<em>Hulu and Hulu Plus</em>: Only a few films we will watch are available on Hulu."
      - "<em>Library Reserve</em>: The library has a copy of most of the films we'll be watching. Each film will be on reserve in the Media Library (basement of West Wing of Golda Meir Library). You may check the DVD out for 2 hours at a time for viewing on the premises. Obviously there are not enough hours in the week for everyone to try to watch the film at the library using the reserve copy. This should be your last resort only if you have no other option."
      - "<em>Other possibilities</em>: If you have access to cable, it is possible your provider offers some sort of On Demand streaming service. You may find a few of the films from this semester available on that service."

      - text: "Each student will be part of a discussion section of 15-20 other students. I've broken up the discussion sections into groups named for one of the directors we'll be watching this semester. You will engage with these smaller groups in online forums each week. Each group will be moderated and graded by a discussion group leader. The discussion group leaders are listed below. If you have questions or concerns about the class, please contact your discussion leader first. They will forward any pertinent questions on to me as necessary."

      - "A note about online courses:"
      - "For many of you this will be the first time taking a class online. You may have one of two misconceptions about the process:"
      - "1) online classes are easier and less work than a traditional face-to-face class."
      - "2) online classes are more intimidating and impersonal than traditional face-to-face classes."
      - "Neither of these are necessarily true. While it may take some adjustment to get used the way a class functions online, many students discover that while the class is still a lot of work, it may in fact offer a very rich educational experience in which they are able to get to know their classmates and instructors better than through a traditional face-to-face class. In order to excel in the online environment, a few things are required of the student: 1) motivation. Since there are no fixed times for the class to meet, it will be up to you to fix time in your schedule each week to meet all the requirements. It is recommended that you set up a regularly weekly schedule that works best for you so that you will have time set aside each week for this class's required activities. 2) engagement. The old adage that you only get out what you put in is still true in the online environment. If you make an effort to think through the assignments and post thoughtful discussion to the forums, you will end up having a richer educational experience than if you simply try to meet the bare minimum of the requirements."

The quizzes will cover material from the assigned weekly readings and from lecture. The worst quiz grade over the course of the semester will be dropped. You will also have a midterm and final exam, as well as two visual essay projects."
      - text: "Discussion is a critical part of this class. You will post to discussion forums every week of the semester except for the two weeks in which we take exams. Unlike in your face-to-face discussions where you probably had several students who did all the talking while most students sat quietly in the background, in this class everyone will participate in the discussion about the movies and lectures. Each week you will take some time to reflect on the movie you've watched and the questions about the movie the lecture has raised for you, and you will post some thoughts about the film online in the D2L discussion forums. Then, a few days later, you will read other people's posts and respond to someone else's thoughts. We should be able to generate some vibrant ongoing conversations throughout the semester. "

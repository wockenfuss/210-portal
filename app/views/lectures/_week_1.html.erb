NARRATIVE STRATEGIESâ€¨
As perhaps you've guessed from the class's name, we're going to spend this semester trying to dig into the narrative form of filmmaking and examine in depth different techniques that filmmakers have employed in order to tell stories with images. 

If you've taken Film 114 and Film 210, you've taken the department's two foundational classes designed to provide you with an understanding both of film's cultural history as well as of fundamental filmmaking techniques. This class is intended to apply what you've learned in those classes in a more in-depth fashion, analyzing a variety of films throughout the semester while applying lessons learned by generating some of our own narrative scenarios. 

Throughout the semester we'll be fleshing out an idea of what constitutes "traditional" narrative structure. We'll also be attempting to flesh out some ideas about what variations on traditional form are possible and why someone might want to deviate from more accepted patterns. In other words, what unusual or unexpected effects on the viewer can be achieved by avoiding those traditional patterns? 

NARRATIVE FORM - CONVENTION AND EXPECTATION
When a filmmaker makes a film, she is typically not simply interested in telling a story. Usually, she's interested in created an emotional experience, something that involves taking the viewer through a progression of a range of feelings. The filmmaker is highly attuned to the viewer's emotional state at all times and intentionally employs specific strategies to move the viewer from one emotional state to another. 

In order to create this progression, the filmmaker makes use of something called "narrative form." When we talk about narrative form, we're talking about an established system that creates expectations: a pattern. Those expectations are created when a pattern is repeated over a long period of time: we see a certain combination of shots, and we develop expectations about what's coming next. 

We can call these patterns conventions. Conventions can be useful tools that filmmakers employ to complex effect, or they can be cliched, cheap shorthand, intended to trigger stereotypical emotional reactions by rote.

The expectations created by conventions are also tools that a filmmaker can use. If the filmmaker knows the viewer has certain expectations, she can choose to respond to those expectations in different ways. She can choose to fulfill those expectations, giving the viewers what they think they're going to get. Or she can instead choose to thwart expectations, denying the viewers the resolution of those expectations. Additionally, she can choose to delay expectations, forcing viewers to wait in anticipation. 

Each of these strategies can result in a variety of different effects on the viewer. When expectations are fulfilled, a viewer is likely to experience one of a range of emotions, from satisfaction to relief to perhaps a sense of well-being. Delayed expectations may result in curiosity, suspense or anxiety. Thwarted expectations may result in somewhat unpleasant emotions like disappointment or frustration, but they can also result in a situation where viewers are forced to reevaluate their assumptions and perhaps come to see the situation in an entirely different light (this process of reevaluation results in a  fairly complicated experience for the viewer, and as a result is quite popular with a lot of filmmakers. It's going to figure somewhat heavily in a number of the films we watch this semester). It might seem like thwarting expectations results primarily in negative emotions, and so a filmmaker should primarily be interested in fulfilling viewer expectations. But can you think of reasons why thwarting viewer expectations might be useful?

We've already mentioned the way that thwarting expectations can result in reevaluation. Another reason is that if filmmakers only fulfill expectations, then the film viewing experience quickly becomes predictable and dull. As soon as an expectation is raised the viewer already knows exactly what will happen.

CONVENTION IN ACTION
Let's think about some examples of this relationship between convention and expectation and how filmmakers might choose to make use of them.

Genre filmmaking is often a breeding ground for convention (in fact, you could make an argument that a genre is nothing but a collection of conventions). Here's a convention from horror films: 

Character X is alone in the house. Character X hears something in a different part of the house and goes to investigate. Most likely there's some spooky music playing. 

What are your expectations regarding what's going to happen? You've seen this so many times that it's become pretty obvious. Character X encounters the villain and gets killed in some gruesome fashion. At least that's how the convention started. Hearing the sound and going to investigate is a way to create suspense, followed by a shock when the moment of truth arrives. The viewer knows what's going to happen. The only question is when that expectation will be fulfilled.

Conventions, however, are fluid. They don't remain static. They evolve over time. At some point the above convention got tiresome (you could probably make a case that it was always tiresome). After some repetition, it becomes entirely predictable. Once the viewer knows the filmmaker's strategy, then the filmmaker has to change strategies to try to get a step ahead of the viewer's expectations. Here's a scene from Alien by Ridley Scott that presents a variation on the original convention:

The heroes hear something and go to find it. The heroes (and the viewer) are led to believe that they've found it. The filmmaker has established the expectation that we're about to encounter the alien. However, this time, the filmmaker chooses to thwart that expectation rather than fulfill it, resulting in a slightly more complex range of emotions. At the height of suspense, the danger is revealed to be something harmless, and both the viewer and characters let their guard down, experiencing a sense of relief and perhaps even some degree of humor (note the complexity of moving from fear and suspense to shock to relief and laughter).

However, you've seen this variation many times before as well, so much so that we can say that this variation has also become it's own convention. Does anyone (who hasn't seen Alien), want to venture a guess as to what happens next? (Hint: to the guy who goes after the cat?). 

The filmmaker builds up the suspense, then punctures it by revealing that there was no danger. Then when we no longer expect danger, it strikes suddenly (Yes, I'm afraid Harry Dean Stanton is doomed), and Ridley Scott is able to have his cake and eat it too, putting the viewer through suspenseful agony, but still able to pop a surprise on the viewer as well. This is a rather different emotional experience from the first version where the character hears something and then gets killed. 

But as the viewer becomes accustomed to this convention as well, a war of escalation takes place, with the filmmaker having to constantly try to get one step ahead of the viewer, and you can end up with a film experience that functions something like an elaborate game. The viewer says, "I know what you're doing." The filmmaker responds "I know that you know what I'm doing."
"I know that you know that I know what your'e doing."
"I know that you know that I know that you know what I'm doing." etc.

This scene from A Perfect Getaway illustrates this idea of a filmmaker playing games with the viewer:

There's a bit of a taunt contained in this scene. The filmmaker is saying, Hey, I know that you know that this is a genre movie and that you have a certain set of expectations. By acknowledging the game, the filmmaker throws the viewer off track. Now when the filmmaker actively employs a cliche, we don't know whether to take it at face value or to expect some sort of misdirection (hint for this movie: expect misdirection). 

In essence, this can be one description of the entirety of the process of making a narrative film. The filmmaker is engaging with the entire history of filmmaking, working off expectations created by others, playing with and against ideas used many times by other filmmakers.

A significant part of the moviemaking process has become the task of manipulating and controlling viewer expectation. This is why an understanding of all the variables within the narrative system is so important: because viewer expectations depend entirely on the history of this system. 

CONVENTIONS AS STRUCTURAL PATTERNS
Let's talk about a few examples of larger patterns that have recurred throughout film history and have become patterns for providing an overall structure to a film's progression. These patterns are a little broader than the concept of genre. 

The Journey
In this type of film, time is measured out through space. The journey is typically divided up into a series of destinations that incrementally progress through the narrative. As the characters reach one destination, a new one replaces it to provide the next short-term goal in the viewer's mind. The string of mini-journeys functions as a sort of scaffold on which to hang the rest of the film, the character development and emotional progression.

Detective Story
Here instead of using distance, time is measured out through discoveries. Each small discovery moves the viewer and characters one step closer to the long-term goal and is quickly replaced with a new short-term goal that will lead to the next discovery. 

Musical
This pattern is a little old-fashioned but has seen a little bit of recurrence of late (particularly in India). In the musical, time is measured out through songs in much the same way it's measured out through destinations and discoveries in the above patterns.


These are just a few of many patterns that have evolved over time. We'll encounter more as we move through the semester. The point is that patterns evolve because they are useful to filmmakers who use them as tools to shape and manipulate viewer expectations throughout the course of a film. 

LIMBO
The film that we're watching this week makes interesting use of filmic convention. John Sayles makes a series of choices that are designed to create certain expectations in the viewer. He then carefully chooses which expectations to fulfill and which to thwart based on the very specific emotional state he's looking to create in the viewer. 

It's going to be most useful for us this week to first watch the film without too much information about it. That way we can let the film work on us in the way Sayles intends. Then we can look back and examine what kind of experience Sayles' choices created for us and why they had the impact that they did. So at this point, if you haven't watched the film, you should watch it now.
